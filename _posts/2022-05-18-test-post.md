This is a first standard test post. This should be the excerpt. We need more words here! We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here! We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!We need more words here!

This should come after the excerpt. This is  implemented by adding:

```yaml
excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->"
```

... kind of magic :)
